Derived from the declared role in the layout contract plus explicit owner
adjudications, never from a list of filenames. A list of filenames decays
in two directions at once: it stops matching what is there, and nothing
notices.

Every rule that matches is collected rather than the first one winning. A
first-match chain silently prefers whichever rule was written earliest,
and a later contradictory rule is never seen. Two matches is a refusal,
and so is none.

THE QUESTION THIS EXISTS TO ANSWER

Not "what licence is this" but "may this be published". Those differ
exactly where it matters. Reference material consulted while building an
ontology is cited, not redistributed, and a repository that contains it
is redistributing it whatever the README says.

There are three third-party answers here, not one. A paid standard may
not be redistributed at all. A permissive upstream may, on condition --
and a condition nobody checks is a condition nobody meets, so the
attribution both vendored licences require is a check below rather than
a notice file somebody remembers to update.
