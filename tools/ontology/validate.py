Two rungs, and the second is the one that makes the first mean anything.

  conformance   the authored ontology validated against every shape set.
                Violations are findings.

  falsification the bad-examples fixture validated against the same
                shapes. It is built to break them, so violations here are
                the expected result and their *absence* is the finding.

A shape set that reports no violations is ambiguous on its own: the data
might be clean, or the constraint might be selecting nothing. That
happens more easily than it sounds -- a SPARQL constraint filtering on a
namespace prefix string still runs when the string is stale, matches
nothing, and reports success. This repository moved namespaces recently
and had exactly that construct in it, which is why the second rung is
not optional.

SCOPE

The data graph is the authored ontology *plus* the vendored upstream
extracts. Both are needed: a shape asking whether a class reaches
cco:ont00001379 through subClassOf has nothing to walk without CCO, and
answers "no" for every subject. That report is indistinguishable from a
real defect, and this tool produced it -- 202 violations that were a
property of the scope.

Loading the extracts creates the opposite risk, so violations are split
by whose term the focus node is. A violation against an upstream IRI is a
finding about the extract; only violations against terms this repository
authored are findings about this ontology.
