"""Resolve logical component ids to paths.

Everything that needs a path asks here, so relocating a file is a change
to `config/repository-layout.yaml` rather than an edit across every module
that mentioned it.

Standalone by design. The equivalent in the project this was carried from
lived inside a package whose `__init__` loaded an entire agent runtime, so
asking where a file lived pulled in 44 modules and most of a second. That
was recorded as a known wart there; there is no reason to inherit it.

The only dependency is PyYAML, and the only thing this module does is read
one file and answer questions about it.
