# How this repository is built

Carried over from the BFO-Aligned ValueNet project, which used this method
through eight gated phases. It is written down because the method is worth
more than any of the tools, and because most of it was learned by getting
things wrong in ways that looked right.

Nothing here is aspirational. Every rule below exists because its absence
produced a specific defect that shipped or nearly shipped.

---

## 1. The one idea

**A check must report on the thing it claims to report on.**

That sounds too obvious to write down. It is, by a wide margin, the most
frequent defect this project has found — eight distinct instances, every
one of which produced a green result that meant nothing:

| What was claimed | What was actually measured |
|---|---|
| every tracked file was swept | the three new files were untracked, so none were opened |
| the orchestrator exited 0 | `\| tail` exited 0; the program had failed |
| the category is derived from edges | a helper property; replacing the function with `endswith("Disposition")` passed all 22 tests |
| the corpus is UTF-8 clean | `text=True` decoded as cp1252 and corrupted 3 of 12 files, then blamed the corpus |
| ontology text never becomes markup | the scan matched the comment *explaining* the rule |
| the workflow checks out full history | the string `fetch-depth: 0` appeared in a comment while the step said `1` |
| no fragment went unverified | the test read a key the tool never returned, so it examined an empty list |
| the published checksums verify | they listed three files that are not published and omitted the archive that is |

The pattern is always the same: something adjacent to the question was
measured, and the adjacency was invisible from the result. A passing test
is not evidence. **Evidence is a passing test plus a demonstration that it
can fail.**

### It runs in the other direction too

Every row above is a green result that meant nothing. The same defect
produces red results that mean nothing, and those are harder to spot
because a failing check looks like it is doing its job.

The SHACL ladder here reported 202 violations of the form *"Capability
must reach cco:Agent Capability via subClassOf+"*. Every one of them was
true, and none of them was a defect in the ontology: CCO was not in the
repository, so the chain the constraint walks stopped at the first
upstream parent and the answer was no for every subject. The report named
the ontology and measured the scope.

The fix was not to relax the constraint. It was to make the tool say
**not evaluable** when a shape set reasons over a vocabulary that is
absent — and then to put the vocabulary in. With BFO and CCO vendored,
116 of 116 capability classes reach the anchor; before, 10 did. The 106
in between were an artifact of the question being asked without the
vocabulary needed to answer it.

A check that cannot distinguish *"the answer is no"* from *"I could not
ask"* is not reporting on what it claims.

---

## 2. Falsification is not optional

Before a check counts as done:

1. **Break the thing it protects.** Revert the fix, plant the defect,
   introduce the typo.
2. **Assert the mutation applied** — `assert mutated != original` — before
   running anything. Three separate "successful falsifications" in ValueNet
   were no-ops: a `.replace()` that matched nothing, a tamper that set a
   value already equal, a mutation calling a function that did not exist.
3. **Require the specific test to fail**, and check *which* tests failed.
   A mutation that fails twenty tests including unrelated ones is usually a
   broken mutation, not a strong check.
4. **Restore, and confirm the restore.**

### Verify the mutation moved what is measured

A falsification has two halves and the second is easy to skip: change
something, *and check the change reached the quantity the check reads*. Three
attempts in one afternoon failed this way, each looking like a passing check:

| the mutation | what was verified | what was actually true |
|---|---|---|
| edited a line to change a `kind` | nothing | the line did not contain the string being replaced; the file never changed |
| appended a label to a slice | the file digest moved | the term was never declared, so it was not a focus node |
| a slow run implied a slow query | nothing | a second job was using the same eight cores |

Every one of those was reported to a human as "the check passed" or "this is
slower", and every one was a statement about the test rather than the thing
tested. The file digest changing is not enough. **Assert the measured number
moved** — the finding count, the digest, the row — before believing what the
check then says about it.

The third row is the same defect wearing different clothes: a measurement taken
while something else was running is a measurement of the machine. And before
concluding anything from a timing, find out what this machine's variance is —
the same unchanged suite here has been timed at 6m25s and 10m51s, so any
difference narrower than that is noise being read as a result.

### Falsify the right thing

A falsification can miss for the same reason a check can. When a corpus
edit failed to move a digest that should have moved, the first conclusion
was that the pin was broken. It was not: the edit had landed on an *object
property's* definition, and the index only reads classes. The pin was
right and the falsification was aimed at something the measurement never
looked at.

Aim mutations at the exact artifact under test, and say which one you hit.

### Stage before you mutate

`git checkout -- <file>` restores from the index. Twice, work that was
never staged was destroyed by "restoring" after a falsification. Stage the
intended state first, or copy it somewhere outside the repository.

## 3. Gates, and who holds them

Work happens in phases. Each phase ends at a **gate**, and a gate is held
by a person who did not do the work.

- The gate states its conditions **before** the phase starts.
- Nothing is pushed without explicit authorization.
- A phase that adds tests is expected to be red against the previous
  evidence baseline; the evidence commit follows and makes it green.
- When the reviewer raises a concern and you disagree, say so once, with
  the measurement. If they repeat it, that is the decision — implement it.

The reviewer's job is to find checks that certify more than they prove.
Assume they will, because they did, repeatedly, in every phase.

---

## 4. Evidence artifacts

Some measurements are expensive: a four-browser run, a fresh clone, a
reasoner pass. Those are run deliberately and their results **committed as
records**, then policed by cheap tests on every run.

Rules that took several attempts to get right:

**A record describes a commit it does not live in.** It cannot describe
itself. Say so in the record, and have the test require ancestry rather
than equality.

**Normalise provenance out of any digest meant to detect content change.**
A digest that includes the commit hash, a build stamp, or a generator path
measures the repository's history rather than its content. Classify every
top-level field as content or provenance, and fail when a new field
appears unclassified.

**Scope a freshness digest to what was actually examined.** A browser
review digest that covered the whole artifact went stale on every commit,
because the download bundle's timestamp comes from the commit. Name the
files the check loads. A missing one is fatal, not skipped — a digest over
five of six files is a perfectly stable number describing less than it
claims.

**Two moments, two questions.** At capture time, require the deployment to
be the checkout being measured. After the record is committed the branch
moves on, so repository tests can only ask about the frozen fact. Never
store a value that describes live state; recompute it.

**Bind any digest a record cites.** A bare `sha256` is unfalsifiable — any
64 hex characters satisfy a length check. Record the commit too, and have
the test recompute the digest from that blob.

---

## 5. Say what was not done

The single most valuable habit. Every record carries an explicit
**not covered** section, and tests enforce that it stays honest.

- Playwright's WebKit is **not Safari**. A test forbids the word "Safari"
  anywhere in the browser record except the not-covered note.
- Reading the accessibility tree is **availability for announcement**, not
  an announcement. No screen reader ran, so no announcement was observed —
  and a test scans the record requiring every use of the word to sit inside
  a statement saying so.
- A viewport of 320×256 is a **reflow-equivalent**, not an observed 400%
  zoom run, and reflow is WCAG 1.4.10 rather than 1.4.4.

A gate that reports `passed` over an unperformed manual check is the same
overclaim in a different costume. Split the verdict: what the tool can
determine, and the gate, which includes what only a person can state.

**Evidence a tool cannot produce needs an intake path.** If a manual
check's status lives in source, closing it means editing Python — a strange
way to record that somebody listened to a screen reader, and it makes
"performed" a one-word change with nothing attached. Put it in a data file
with a schema that refuses `performed` without the tester, date, platform,
versions, and what was observed.

## 6. Derive, never transcribe

Any number in prose is wrong eventually.

ValueNet published a digest — `27931563…` — that nothing in the tree could
reproduce, because the measure had never been implemented. It existed only
as a figure in a plan document. The fix was not a corrected number; it was
an executable normalisation with a pinned result and a falsification.

- Membership lists are derived from two independent sources and the build
  **refuses when they disagree**, rather than preferring one.
- Inventories in documents are regenerated and bound by a test, so a record
  that stops matching the corpus fails rather than quietly ageing.
- A control that lives only in a test is a control the build does not have.
  Put the refusal in the builder *and* the test.

---

## 7. Determinism

If a build is not reproducible, no checksum it publishes means anything.

- Sorted inputs, never filesystem order.
- Timestamps from the commit or `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`, never `now()`.
- Bytes copied, never re-serialised. A round trip through a parser produces
  a file that says the same thing and hashes differently.
- Archive metadata pinned: member order, one timestamp, fixed permissions,
  fixed creating system. Zip stores seconds in two-second steps — truncate
  explicitly rather than letting it round.
- Verify across **paths**, not just twice in the same directory. Build in a
  clone at a different depth and compare.

---

## 8. Pin exactly, and pin once

- Python dependencies pinned to exact versions in a requirements file that
  is verified by installing into an empty environment and running the suite
  there. ValueNet's was wrong twice.
- Node pinned in `.nvmrc`, read by both `nvm` and `actions/setup-node`, so
  there is one version rather than two that can drift. A test reads the
  pin and **fails** when the running version differs — a skip is
  indistinguishable from a pass in every summary line.
- GitHub Actions pinned to commit SHAs. A tag can be moved.
- Any external authority pinned to a **commit**, never a branch. A
  remote-tracking ref moves when somebody else pushes, which would let a
  licensing result change with no commit in this repository.

### Upstream vocabulary is vendored, not imported

An `owl:imports` resolves over the network when the validator runs. That
makes the result a function of the day it ran and of what the far end
served, which is the opposite of what a check is for. So the upstream is
pinned to a commit, fetched once, reduced to the terms this repository
actually names plus their structural ancestry, and committed.

Four things make that honest rather than convenient:

- **The url names the commit**, so the bytes cannot change, and the
  digest is recorded and checked anyway. A proxy, a TLS appliance, or a
  truncated download all serve different bytes from the same url and none
  of them announce it.
- **The licence is read from the artifact.** The pins declare
  `CC-BY-4.0`, and the build requires the source's own `dcterms:license`
  to say so before it will vendor anything. An SPDX identifier typed into
  a config file is a claim; checking it against the file is evidence.
- **The extract is regenerable and byte-identical.** The serialiser is
  written out rather than delegated, because a recorded digest over a
  library's output is a measurement of the library. A weekly job refetches
  the pinned sources and requires the committed files to match.
- **The extract says what it is not.** It is partial: every axiom whose
  object is an anonymous class expression is dropped, so a reasoner over
  it derives strictly less than one over the upstream and it cannot be
  used to claim consistency with it. That sentence is in the header of
  each file, in the manifest, and in the validation report — see §5.

Redistribution is a licensing question, not a technical one. BFO is
CC BY 4.0 and CCO is BSD-3-Clause, so vendoring is permitted **on
condition of attribution** — and a condition nobody checks is a condition
nobody meets, so the licensing tool reads the pins and fails when a
declared attribution is missing from the notice file.

---

## 9. Tests, specifically

- **Test the shipped artifact.** Ranking that ships as JavaScript is tested
  by running that file under Node, not by reimplementing it in Python — a
  reimplementation proves the reimplementation works.
- **Refusals are the interesting tests.** Assert what the build declines to
  do: two labels, a missing definition, an unresolved parent, a mapping on
  an undeclared subject.
- **Guard the guards.** A page list that fetched nothing satisfies every
  naive assertion. Assert that the thing being checked was non-empty.
- **No test may depend on build output.** Reading a gitignored artifact
  makes a test pass, fail, or skip depending on whether somebody built
  first. Generate it in a fixture.
- **A skip is a pass in disguise.** Where a dependency is genuinely
  required, fail; where an environment legitimately cannot run a check,
  move the check to where the environment exists rather than skipping.
- **Never commit behind a green checker.** One commit here rode through on
  `check_site && git commit` while the test suite was red.

---

## 10. Licensing, from the first commit

Decide what may be published before publishing anything.

- Every tracked file gets **exactly one disposition**, derived from
  recorded provenance plus explicit owner adjudications — never a list of
  filenames.
- Both directions are policed: a file matching no rule is a refusal, and an
  adjudication matching no file is an exception granted for nothing.
- Reference material you do not own is **cited, never redistributed**. A
  README saying "this repository does not redistribute them" is not a
  licence; the repository's contents are.
- There are **three** third-party answers, not one. A paid standard may
  not be redistributed at all. A permissive upstream may, on condition.
  Your own work is a third case. Collapsing the first two into "third
  party" makes the tool either refuse legitimate vendoring or wave through
  an infringement.
- Licence texts are the pinned instrument, not an SPDX template. ValueNet
  shipped a BSD-3-Clause *template* with `Copyright (c) <year> <owner>`
  placeholders, and the test asserted only a phrase every BSD variant
  contains.

---

## 11. Writing it down

Commit messages carry the reasoning, not the diff. What was wrong, why the
fix is the fix, what was falsified and how. When a defect had a second
defect underneath it, say so — that is the part a reader cannot recover.

Decisions that are *not* being made get recorded too, with their evidence
and what would close them, and a test asserting the status stays open.
Two such records exist in ValueNet: label capitalisation and ontology IRI
form. Neither authorises an edit; both stop the question being rediscovered.

---

## 12. What this costs

This method is slow. In ValueNet it caught, among others: a corrupted
corpus measurement that blamed the corpus, a licence template shipped as a
licence, 45 tests silently dropped by a missing optional dependency, a
bypass control unreachable by keyboard in one browser engine, an ontology
term drawn in a diagram that did not exist, and a checksum file that
verified three files nobody could download.

None of those were found by writing more code. All were found by asking
what a passing result actually demonstrated.
