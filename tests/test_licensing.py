"""What this repository may publish, decided before it publishes.

These tests were written while the repository was redistributing a paid
ISO standard from a public URL, with a README on the same commit saying
it did not. The history has since been rewritten and the file is ignored
rather than tracked, so they pass -- and they are what stops that being
something somebody has to remember.

Two of them test the rule rather than the current corpus. Once the files
stopped being tracked, a test asserting on the classified set would pass
by finding nothing, and would go on passing if the rule broke.
