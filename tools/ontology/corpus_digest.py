"""Measure the ontology, so a change to it is visible.

    python tools/ontology/corpus_digest.py
    python tools/ontology/corpus_digest.py -o config/corpus-digest.json

Two measures, because one is not enough.

GROUND DIGEST

Triples with no blank node anywhere. These carry the named terms, and
they are stable across parses, so a digest over them changes when and
only when the asserted content changes.

BLANK-NODE FINGERPRINT

Blank nodes are renamed by every parse, so they cannot be digested
directly -- a naive set comparison reports every restriction as both
added and removed. What is stable is their shape: how many there are,
how many triples touch them, and the multiset of predicate/object pairs
with the identities erased.

Between them the two cover every triple. That matters: a measure that
covered only ground triples would be blind to exactly the constructs OWL
uses most, and an ontology can be rewritten substantially without a
single named term changing.

WHAT IS MEASURED

The scope comes from the layout contract, not from a directory walk. A
walk would pick up the reasoner's own output and a fixture whose purpose
is to be invalid, and would then report the result as a property of the
ontology.
